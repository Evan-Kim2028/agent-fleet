"""Git and GitHub plumbing for the gate: resolve a PR head, run the gate's worktrees.

The gate never operates on the caller's checkout. It creates a detached
worktree at the PR head so that a reviewer agent, a verifier writing a new test
file, and a fixer committing and pushing all work against a known, immutable
commit — and the operator's own working tree is never dirtied by a run.

Every worktree is created with ``--detach`` at an explicit sha. A gate run that
crashed mid-round leaves a directory behind but no branch to half-update, and
the next run removes and recreates it.
